PulseshapingPulsemeasurementSimulations
=======================================
by Daniel Wilcox

These Python simulations allow for direct comparisons between pulse-shaping pulse-measurement techniques

Included methods: SPIDER, MIIPS, FROG, CRT, SPEAR, and ChirpScan

To run the code, install Python (I use Anaconda Python) with Numpy and Scipy and Matplotlib and then run a command something like this:

ipython MasterScript.py 0

where the 0 means the first test pulse; valid values include 0, 1, 2, and 3

Documentation is somewhat included in the comments; if you need more documentation email me at dewilcox@umich.edu
